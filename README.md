# AI Wardrobe

AI Wardrobe is a full-stack wardrobe and outfit planning app. Users can sign in, complete onboarding, manage closet items, build outfits, save favourites, and generate virtual try-on previews from their profile/model image and selected clothing.

## Features

- Auth0 login and signup.
- Centered onboarding for body profile, optional style preferences, and model image setup.
- Profile management for display name, required age/gender body profile fields, optional measurements/body shape, style preferences, and profile/model photo upload.
- Closet management for adding, editing, searching, and uploading clothing item images.
- Outfit builder and saved outfit library with favourite outfit support.
- AI virtual try-on generation using Replicate, with generated images stored through Cloudinary.
- Upload guideline modals for profile and clothing images.

## Architecture

This repository is a monorepo with a Next.js frontend and an Express/MongoDB backend.

- `frontend/`: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Auth0 client integration, onboarding/profile/closet/outfit UI.
- `backend/`: Express REST API, Auth0 JWT validation, MongoDB/Mongoose models, Cloudinary uploads, Replicate try-on route, Jest/Supertest tests.
- Root package: shared scripts for running the frontend and backend together.

The frontend requests Auth0 access tokens and sends them to the backend. The backend validates those tokens, stores user/closet/outfit data in MongoDB, uploads images to Cloudinary, and calls Replicate for try-on generation.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
cd ..
```

2. Create the environment files:

- `backend/.env`
- `frontend/.env`

Use the examples in the Setup section below.

3. Start MongoDB if you are using a local database.

4. Start the app from the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open the frontend:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The backend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

## Setup

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
cd ..
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ai-wardrobe
PORT=5000
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://your-api-audience
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key

## Frontend Routes

| URL | Page |
| --- | --- |
| `/login` | Auth0 sign-in entry point |
| `/signup` | Centered Auth0 sign-up entry point |
| `/onboarding` | Onboarding flow after Auth0 sign-in |
| `/` | Home dashboard with wardrobe stats and outfit generation entry points |

## Onboarding And Auth

- `/signup` and `/login` use centered single-column auth layouts.
- `/onboarding?step=body-profile` collects first name, last name, age, and gender as required fields. Measurements and body shape are optional.
- `/onboarding?step=about-yourself` allows users to select style preferences or skip with an empty style preference list.
- `/onboarding?step=select-model` lets users upload a photo or choose a default model. Uploaded photos preview inside the drag-and-drop box.

Authenticated backend routes require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## API Conventions

- Request and response bodies are JSON unless uploading images.
- Clothing item categories are `upper_body`, `lower_body`, `dresses`, `outerwear`, `shoes`, or `accessories`.
- `GET /api/clothingItems/me` supports query filters for owned closet data.
- Outfit item IDs must belong to the authenticated user.
- Outfit items must have distinct categories; duplicate item categories are rejected.
- Profile PATCH routes reject unsupported fields and run Mongoose validators before saving.
- `stylePreferences` must be an array, but it may be empty.
- Body profile measurements and body type are optional.
- Numeric body profile fields must be non-negative when provided.
- The try-on route expects a user/model image and selected outfit item images.

## Frontend Conventions

- `@/` imports use the frontend path alias.
- Reusable UI lives under `frontend/components/`.
- Authenticated API calls use `getAuthHeaders()` from `frontend/lib/api/auth.ts`.
- API URLs come from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- Tailwind theme tokens are declared in `frontend/app/globals.css`.
- Logged-in app pages live under `frontend/app/(app)/`.
- Auth pages live under `frontend/app/(auth)/`.
- Onboarding lives outside the app shell at `frontend/app/onboarding/`.

## Main Data Flow

1. User signs in with Auth0.
2. Frontend obtains an access token for the backend API audience.
3. Frontend syncs the user with `POST /api/users/me/sync`.
4. User completes onboarding and saves profile/body/style/model data through `/api/users/me`.
5. Closet and outfit pages read/write authenticated user data through `/api/clothingItems/me` and `/api/outfits/me`.
6. Try-on generation sends the model image and outfit images to `/api/tryon`.
